// resources - resources the base game does not have, as a tesmioloader plugin.
//
// The engine keeps its resources in one global std::vector of 832-byte records
// and resolves every name in every .ini through a single function. That makes
// the whole subsystem reachable from two places:
//
//   rva 0x2AA7C0  ResourceGet(self, name, ...)  the choke point. Hooked inline;
//                 a name resources.ini claims is answered with a record of our
//                 own, everything else falls through to the real lookup.
//   rva 0x9E11C0  the vector object - begin, end, capacity. Publishing a record
//                 is writing `end`; the engine allocates 63 and fills 57, so
//                 six mod resources fit without moving anything.
//   rva 0x2A92D0  the price pass. Walks the vector and writes every record's
//                 price from the production chains. Bracketed, so [base_price]
//                 lands before it and [price] after it.
//   rva 0x185470  the customhouse's own tick, building type 20. Post-hooked so
//                 an already-standing customhouse picks up a resource this
//                 plugin declared after it was built - see CUSTOMS below.
//
// A new record is a clone of a template's, with its own name, caption id and
// cargo meshes. Only the icon is found by name - every mesh path in the base
// game is a literal, which is why AttachResourceMeshes makes the same three
// engine calls the game's own resource table makes.
//
// CUSTOMS. A customhouse's trade storages are plain $STORAGE lines, one per
// transport class, and the game builds that slot list exactly once - while
// building.ini is parsed - by walking whatever this vector looks like at that
// moment. A customhouse already standing (or built in an earlier session)
// therefore freezes its trade list at whatever resources existed then: every
// name [list] declares afterwards is otherwise perfectly tradeable - matching
// transport class, a computed price, trucks that will deliver it - but has no
// slot to be sold from. See the ExtendCustomsStorage block below, which reruns
// that same walk against the live vector once per customhouse.
//
// Everything here is addresses for SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.7. See
// docs/04-adding-resources.md.

// resource at all, unlike a shop's $STORAGE_DEMAND_* or a pharmacy's
// $STORAGE_SPECIAL. That slot list is built once, while building.ini is
// parsed - rva 0xE40F0, FUN_1400e40f0(parser, storage, class, capacity,
// resource), documented in full in plugins/needs/needs.cpp - by walking
// whatever this vector looks like at that moment. A customhouse already
// standing on a map, or built in an earlier session, freezes its trade list
// at whatever resources existed then: every name [list] above declares
// afterwards is otherwise perfectly tradeable - matching transport class, a
// computed price, trucks that will happily deliver it - but has no slot to be
// sold from. Confirmed empirically before this was written: demolishing and
// rebuilding an affected customhouse fixes it immediately.
//
// The fix reruns that same "does this storage have a slot for every resource
// its class can carry" walk against the *live* resource vector, once per
// customhouse, the first time each one ticks after this plugin loads. Every
// structure offset below (B_STORAGES, ST_CLASS, ST_CAPACITY,

//                 hooks for the same reason. Confirmed by disassembly rather
//                 than taken on faith: the building-type dispatcher (rva
//                 0x139A80) calls it only from
//                 `cmp dword ptr [rax+0x360],0x14 / jne .. / call 0x185470`
//                 at rva 0x13E30A - 0x14 is BUILDINGTYPE_CUSTOMHOUSE, and
//                 `rax` there is `building+0x318`, the same type-descriptor
//                 pointer TYPEDESC_OFF names in needs.cpp. The function also
